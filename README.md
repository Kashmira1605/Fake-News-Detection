# Fake-News-Detection

A project to detect fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques, empowering users to differentiate between genuine and fabricated news content.
---

## 📘 **Introduction**

In today's digital era, the widespread dissemination of fake news poses significant risks to public trust and information authenticity. This project leverages NLP and Machine Learning to analyze linguistic patterns and detect fake news effectively.  

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

To design and implement a machine learning-based system that classifies news articles as real or fake by analyzing their textual content.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language:** Python 3  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code  
- **RAM Requirement:** 8 GB (recommended)

### Libraries
1. `pickle` – For serializing and deserializing objects.
2. `tensorflow` – For building and training neural network models.
3. `numpy` – For numerical computations.
4. `pandas` – For data manipulation and analysis.
5. `nltk` – For text preprocessing (e.g., tokenization, lemmatization).
6. `scikit-learn` – For evaluation metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.
7. `streamlit` – For building an interactive web application.
